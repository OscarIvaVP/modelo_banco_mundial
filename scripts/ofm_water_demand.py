        Two types of plantations are considered: "crops" and "trees".

        The irrigation demand for each type is calculated based on a time series of irrigation 
        requirement (mm) obtained from either Aquacrop (for crops) or from a simple KxPET approach 
        for trees.

        The crops to be included in the calculation are listed in the "crops" attribute of the 
        irrigation demand parameter (i.e., parameter end with the suffix "_Dirr").

        The plantation dates of the crops are listed in the "crop_schedules" attribute of the
        irrigation demand parameter. As such, irrigation demand from the same crop (e.g., rice) 
        planted a different times of the year can be considered. The names listed in the crop schedules 
        are the name of the column in the .csv files that contain the time series of irrigation demand
        for each crop schedule. The path to the .csv file is provided in the irrigation demand
        parameter via the "crop_demand_file" key of the "url" attribute.

        The trees to be included in the calculation are listed in the "trees" attribute of the
        irrigation demand parameter. The plantation dates of the trees are not considered in the
        calculation because trees are assumed to be planted once and for all. The names listed in 
        the "trees" attributes are the name of the columns in the .csv file that contain the time
        series of irrigation demand (mm) for each tree type. The path to the .csv file is provided
        in the .csv file whose path is provided in the irrigation demand parameter via the 
        "trees_demand_file" key of the "url" attribute.

        plantations is projected. Parameters of the regression of the area of the plantations is 
        read from the "irrigation_demand_scenario".

        The "url" attribute also provides the paths to two .csv files:

         that is irrigated and the associated efficiency.
         - the "irrigation_demand_scenario" that contains the information to project the farmland
         area for each crop and tree type.
